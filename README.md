# Easy-Budget-Tracker

## Description

The easy budget tracker is a PWA (Progressive web application) that allows users to track their budgets by adding expenses and deposits to a budget set by the user by using the Add and Subract buttons. Users are able to add transactions without an internet connect. When a user adds while offline, they will be stored in an indexedDB and transferred into the database when connection has returned.
